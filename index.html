      The future of eBooks is not in the production of digital photocopies
you can read by the pool. The future of eBooks lies in re-imagining the
book as an open, easily accessible, immersive experience; a connected
community of discovery.

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js"><span class="grey">github.com/</span>futurepress/epub.js</a></h4>
    <p>Epub.js is an open source Javascript library that allows any web page to render Epub documents on any device with a modern browser.</p>

    <div id="reader-wrap">
      <div id="prev" onclick="rendition.prev();" class="arrow">‹</div>
      <div id="reader">
        <div id="area"></div>
      </div>
      <div id="next" onclick="rendition.next();"class="arrow">›</div>
    </div>

    <p>Epub.js contains a flexible rendering engine and provides a simple interface for common ebook functions such as styling, persistence and pagination.</p>
    <p>We release and maintain <a href="https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js">Epub.js on GitHub</a>, with a growing developer community.</p>
