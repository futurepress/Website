The next major release of Epub.js (v0.3) has been merged into [master
on Github](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js) and released on [NPM as epubjs@0.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/epubjs).

This version is a large overhaul of the code, rewritten in ES6 using modules and transpiled to ES5 by Babel. JSDOC documentation for all new updates is now hosted at [epubjs.org/documentation/0.3/](http://epubjs.org/documentation/0.3/).

The reader was moved to its own [epubjs-reader](https://github.com/futurepress/epubjs-reader) repo, and will hopefully get an overhaul soon.

For those of you that haven't tried v0.3 yet, hopefully the transition won't be too painful. More information of process of updating is on the GitHub wiki at:

[Updating-to-v0.3-from-v0.2](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/wiki/Updating-to-v0.3-from-v0.2)

Please reach out with any issues you run into. We'll be available on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/futurepress/epub.js) and reviewing (+ cleaning) the issues on Github as well.
